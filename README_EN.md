# Sorting Algorithms Efficiency Visualization

This program vividly demonstrates the efficiency of various sorting algorithms.

The program generates an array with random values and then applies a sorting algorithm to this array. As the array size gradually increases, the program counts the number of swaps and comparisons made by the chosen sorting algorithm.

## Sorting Algorithms Available in This Program:
- Selection Sort
- Bubble Sort
- Simple and Binary Insertion Sort
- Quick Sort
- Recursive and Iterative Merge Sort

## Program Output:

The X-axis represents the length of the array being sorted.
The Y-axis represents the number of comparisons/swaps, respectively.
